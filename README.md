# 🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis – Data Cleaning & EDA

## 📌 Objective
Analyze the Titanic dataset to explore survival trends based on passenger attributes.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Rows: 891 passengers
- Features: 12

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Process
1. Data Cleaning (nulls, outliers, encoding)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualizations

## 📈 Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Children under 10 had better survival chances.
